                      Rick Lyle was one of the original founders of Petrotek in 1993. He played an early role in the establishment of the firm’s Colorado office and served as a lead engineer for many field projects over his career.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      Outside of his thirty-year practice as a petroleum engineer, Rick loved to travel and is remembered for his sense of adventure and efforts to always find a way to have fun.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Rick passed away in 2024 after a long battle with health complications from a stroke that disabled him in 2011.

                    <p>
                      James Junkin and Mark Sippel were also part of the original four founding engineers that set-up Petrotek in 1993 when their former employer, Research and Engineering Consultants, Inc., closed its doors. Mark left to return to working for an oil producer in Colorado early in the history of Petrotek, and James continued helping Petrotek with IT for over 30 years after he began an independent computer programming career in the mid-1990s.
